## 3. 🧩 Challenges Faced  

The main challenge was to fix the build issues after updating the dependencies. The build was failing with a generic error message, which made it hard to pinpoint the root cause. After some investigation, I found that the issue was related to a JDK version incompatibility. The project was using JDK 24, which is not compatible with Gradle 8.13. I switched to JDK 17 by setting the `org.gradle.java.home` property in the `gradle.properties` file.

## 4. 🧪 Testing & Validation
