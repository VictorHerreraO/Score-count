**Date Completed:**  
2025-10-10

## 1. ‚úÖ What Was Done  

This task involved a comprehensive overhaul of the project's build configuration to enhance stability and prepare it for production releases. The key accomplishments include:

-   **Dependency Updates:** All project dependencies, including the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), Kotlin, and various AndroidX libraries, were updated to their latest stable versions.
-   **Release Build Hardening:** Code minification and obfuscation (`isMinifyEnabled = true`) were enabled for release builds to reduce APK size and protect against reverse-engineering.
-   **Configuration Cleanup:** A deprecated Hilt configuration (`enableAggregatingTask`) was removed from the `app/build.gradle.kts` file, aligning the project with current best practices.

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è How It Was Done  

The process involved several steps to ensure a stable and successful migration:

1.  **Version Research:** I began by researching the latest stable versions for all dependencies listed in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. This was done using online resources like the official Android documentation and Maven Repository.

2.  **TOML Updates:** The `libs.versions.toml` file was updated with the new stable versions. This included significant updates to AGP, Kotlin, Hilt, Room, and Jetpack Compose libraries.

3.  **Gradle Script Modifications:**
    *   In `app/build.gradle.kts`, I set `isMinifyEnabled` to `true` within the `release` build type.
    *   The obsolete `hilt { ... }` block was removed.
    *   The `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` were updated to `36` to meet the requirements of the new library versions.

4.  **Iterative Building & Troubleshooting:** The project was built iteratively after each significant change. This allowed for quick identification and resolution of compilation errors and dependency conflicts.

## 3. üß© Challenges Faced  

The primary challenge was resolving a persistent Hilt compilation error: `java.lang.String com.squareup.javapoet.ClassName.canonicalName()`.

-   **Initial Hypothesis:** The error suggested a conflict between Hilt and `javapoet`. My initial attempts to resolve this by updating Hilt and KSP versions were unsuccessful.
-   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    1.  I tried explicitly adding a `javapoet` dependency, which did not resolve the issue.
    2.  I experimented with downgrading AGP and Kotlin versions, but this led to further dependency conflicts.
    3.  The breakthrough came when I reverted to a more recent, stable combination of AGP (`8.13.0`) and Kotlin (`2.0.0`) and explicitly added the `com.squareup:javapoet:1.13.0` dependency.
-   **Resolution:** The final successful build was achieved by using a specific combination of library versions and explicitly including the `javapoet` dependency, which resolved the underlying conflict Hilt was experiencing.

## 4. üß™ Testing & Validation  

The primary validation for this task was a successful release build.

-   The command `./gradlew clean assembleRelease` was executed and completed without errors.
-   The resulting APK is now minified and obfuscated, as confirmed by the build logs and the enabled configuration.
