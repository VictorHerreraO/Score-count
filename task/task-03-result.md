# Development Task Completion Report

**Task Title:**
Configure Application Manifest for Production

**Date Completed:**
2025-10-10

## 1. What Was Done

Hardened the AndroidManifest.xml and configured explicit backup rules to improve security and data backup behavior for the Score-Count Android application. This task addressed two critical production-readiness concerns:

1. **Security Enhancement**: Disabled cleartext (unencrypted HTTP) traffic at the manifest level
2. **Backup Configuration**: Implemented explicit backup rules to control which app data is included in Android's Auto Backup feature

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml`
- `app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml`

**Git Branch:** `feature/task-03-harden-manifest-and-backup-rules`

## 2. How It Was Done

### Security Improvements

Added `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` to the `<application>` tag in AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<application
    ...
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="false">
```

This explicitly disables cleartext HTTP traffic, preventing unencrypted network connections. On older Android APIs, this attribute defaults to `true`, which is a security risk. By setting it to `false`, the app enforces encrypted HTTPS connections only.

### Backup Configuration

Implemented explicit include-only backup rules using Android's Auto Backup framework:

#### backup_rules.xml (API < 31)
Configured for devices running Android versions before API 31 (Android 12). Used the `<full-backup-content>` format with explicit `<include>` rules:

```xml
<full-backup-content>
    <!-- Include Room database files -->
    <include domain="database" path="score-count-database" />
    <include domain="database" path="score-count-database-shm" />
    <include domain="database" path="score-count-database-wal" />

    <!-- Include DataStore preferences -->
    <include domain="file" path="datastore/settings.preferences_pb" />
</full-backup-content>
```

#### data_extraction_rules.xml (API >= 31)
Configured for devices running Android 12 and above. Implemented rules for both `cloud-backup` and `device-transfer` scenarios:

```xml
<data-extraction-rules>
    <cloud-backup>
        <!-- Room database and DataStore includes -->
    </cloud-backup>

    <device-transfer>
        <!-- Room database and DataStore includes -->
    </device-transfer>
</data-extraction-rules>
```

### Data Identification

Analyzed the codebase to identify which data needs to be backed up:

1. **Room Database**: Located database name in `di/DataModule.kt:29` as `"score-count-database"`
   - Included main database file and WAL/SHM files (SQLite write-ahead log and shared memory)

2. **DataStore Preferences**: Found in `data/datasource/SettingsDataStore.kt:8` as `preferencesDataStore(name = "settings")`
   - Maps to file: `datastore/settings.preferences_pb`

### Architectural Approach

Used **explicit includes** rather than explicit excludes. This "secure by default" approach means:
- Only specified files are backed up
- All other files are automatically excluded
- New files won't accidentally be included in backups
- Reduces attack surface by minimizing exposed data

---

## 3. Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Android Lint Errors

**Issue:**
Initial implementation used explicit `<exclude>` rules to block unwanted files:

```xml
<exclude domain="sharedpref" path="." />
<exclude domain="file" path="." />
<exclude domain="external" path="." />
```

Build failed with lint errors:
```
Error: . is not in an included path [FullBackupContent]
    <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="." />
```

**Root Cause:**
Android's backup XML schema doesn't allow excluding paths that weren't first explicitly included. You cannot exclude from the default "everything" state.

**Resolution:**
Removed all `<exclude>` rules and relied on the include-only approach. When using only `<include>` rules without any `<exclude>` rules, Android automatically excludes everything not explicitly included. This is the recommended approach per Android documentation and results in cleaner, more maintainable configuration.

### Challenge 2: Understanding Backup Domains

**Issue:**
Needed to correctly map application data to Android backup domains (`database`, `file`, `sharedpref`, etc.).

**Resolution:**
- Room databases use `domain="database"`
- DataStore preferences use `domain="file"` (stored in app's files directory)
- Analyzed actual file system structure to confirm paths

## 4. Testing & Validation

### Build Verification

Executed full clean build to verify changes:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

**Result:** ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 6s (119 tasks executed)

### Lint Analysis

- **Before fix:** 9 errors, 20 warnings
- **After fix:** 0 errors, 20 warnings (warnings unrelated to this task)

### Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Criterion 1:** `android:usesCleartextTraffic` attribute is present and set to `false`
   - Verified in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:14`

✅ **Criterion 2:** Backup configuration files explicitly define what is included and excluded from backups
   - `backup_rules.xml`: Includes only Room database and DataStore files
   - `data_extraction_rules.xml`: Includes only Room database and DataStore files for both cloud-backup and device-transfer

### Security Impact

1. **Network Security:** App now rejects all cleartext HTTP connections, enforcing HTTPS
2. **Data Privacy:** Only user-essential data (match history and settings) included in backups
3. **Attack Surface Reduction:** Sensitive or unnecessary files automatically excluded from backup and restore operations

---

## Additional Notes

The implementation follows Android best practices:
- Uses explicit includes for better security posture
- Supports both legacy (API < 31) and modern (API >= 31) backup systems
- Includes all SQLite-related files (main DB, WAL, SHM) for data integrity
- Clear documentation in XML comments for future maintainers
