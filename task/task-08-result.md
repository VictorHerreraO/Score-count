# Development Task Completion Report

**Task Title:**
Fix Data Integrity and Data Layer Issues (Task-08)

**Date Completed:**
2025-10-10

---

## 1. What Was Done

Fixed two critical data layer issues:

1. **Data Loss in MatchMapper**: The mapper was hardcoding player IDs to `0` when converting from database entities to domain models, resulting in data loss during bidirectional mapping.

2. **Global DataStore Extension**: The `Context.settingsDataStore` extension was defined globally in `SettingsDataStore.kt`, which is not ideal for dependency injection and testing.

**Solution approach**: Instead of adding player ID columns to the database (which would require migration), the `Match` domain model was simplified to remove the unnecessary `Player` objects and use plain strings for player names. This aligns the domain model with actual usage patterns—player IDs are only needed during active gameplay, not for historical match records.

---

## 2. How It Was Done

### 2.1 Match Domain Model Simplification

**Before:**
```kotlin
data class Match(
    val id: String,
    val players: Pair<Player, Player>,  // Player objects with IDs
    val score: Pair<Int, Int>,
    val date: Long
)
```

**After:**
```kotlin
data class Match(
    val id: String,
    val playerOneName: String,
    val playerTwoName: String,
    val playerOneScore: Int,
    val playerTwoScore: Int,
    val date: Long
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Player IDs (`1`, `2`) are only relevant during active gameplay for serving logic and score tracking
- Historical match records only need player names and final scores
- The database (`MatchEntity`) already stores names as strings, not player objects
- Simplifying the model eliminates the impedance mismatch between domain and data layers

### 2.2 MatchMapper Updates

**Before (with data loss):**
```kotlin
fun mapFromEntity(entity: MatchEntity): Match {
    return Match(
        id = entity.id.toString(),
        players = Player(id = 0, name = entity.playerOneName) to
                  Player(id = 0, name = entity.playerTwoName),  // Hardcoded IDs!
        score = entity.playerOneScore to entity.playerTwoScore,
        date = entity.date
    )
}
```

**After (clean 1:1 mapping):**
```kotlin
fun mapFromEntity(entity: MatchEntity): Match {
    return Match(
        id = entity.id.toString(),
        playerOneName = entity.playerOneName,
        playerTwoName = entity.playerTwoName,
        playerOneScore = entity.playerOneScore,
        playerTwoScore = entity.playerTwoScore,
        date = entity.date
    )
}
```

Now the mapper perfectly mirrors the database schema with **zero data loss**.

### 2.3 DataStore Dependency Injection

**Before:**
```kotlin
// SettingsDataStore.kt - Global extension (bad for DI)
val Context.settingsDataStore: DataStore<Preferences> by preferencesDataStore(name = "settings")

// DataModule.kt
fun provideSettingsDataStore(@ApplicationContext context: Context): DataStore<Preferences> {
    return context.settingsDataStore  // Using global extension
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
// SettingsDataStore.kt - Global extension removed

// DataModule.kt - Private extension scoped to module
private val Context.settingsDataStore: DataStore<Preferences> by preferencesDataStore(name = "settings")

private val Context.gameStateDataStore: DataStore<GameStateProto> by dataStore(
    fileName = "game_state.pb",
    serializer = GameStateSerializer
)

@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object DataModule {
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideSettingsDataStore(@ApplicationContext context: Context): DataStore<Preferences> {
        return context.settingsDataStore  // Using private extension
    }

    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideGameStateDataStore(@ApplicationContext context: Context): DataStore<GameStateProto> {
        return context.gameStateDataStore
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- DataStore instances provided exclusively via Hilt
- Private extensions prevent accidental direct access outside the module
- Better testability and proper separation of concerns
- Consistent approach for both Preferences and Proto DataStore

### 2.4 Code Updates

Updated all code that uses `Match`:

1. **ScoreViewModel.kt**: Creates `Match` with simplified structure
   ```kotlin
   val match = Match(
       id = "",
       playerOneName = gameState.player1.name,
       playerTwoName = gameState.player2.name,
       playerOneScore = gameState.player1SetsWon,
       playerTwoScore = gameState.player2SetsWon,
       date = System.currentTimeMillis()
   )
   ```

2. **MatchHistoryScreen.kt**: Displays player names directly
   ```kotlin
   Text(text = "${match.playerOneName} vs. ${match.playerTwoName}")
   Text(text = "$date | ${match.playerOneScore} - ${match.playerTwoScore}")
   ```

3. **All test files**: Updated 4 test files with Match instances
   - `MatchMapperTest.kt`: Comprehensive bidirectional mapping tests
   - `MatchUseCasesTest.kt`: Use case tests with simplified Match
   - `MatchHistoryViewModelTest.kt`: ViewModel tests
   - `ScoreViewModelTest.kt`: Auto-save tests

---

## 3. Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Deciding Between Adding IDs vs Simplifying Model

**Initial approach**: Add `player_one_id` and `player_two_id` columns to `MatchEntity` to preserve player IDs.

**Problem**:
- Requires database migration (version bump)
- Existing records would need default IDs assigned
- Player IDs serve no purpose in match history (they're only used during active gameplay)
- Over-engineering for a feature that won't exist (user explicitly stated no plans for player profiles)

**Resolution**:
- Analyzed actual usage of player IDs in the codebase
- Confirmed they're only used for serving logic and score tracking during active games
- Simplified the domain model instead of complicating the database
- Avoided migration, kept code cleaner, and aligned with actual requirements

### Challenge 2: Comprehensive Test Updates

**Problem**: The simplified `Match` model affected multiple test files across different layers.

**Resolution**:
- Systematically identified all files using `Match` via grep
- Updated each test file to use the new structure
- Verified bidirectional mapping tests properly validate data preservation
- Ran full test suite to ensure no regressions (100 tests, all passing)

### Challenge 3: DataStore Extension Visibility

**Problem**: Moving the extension from global scope to module-private scope required careful import management.

**Resolution**:
- Moved both DataStore extensions to `DataModule.kt` as private extensions
- Removed unused imports from `SettingsDataStore.kt`
- Ensured Hilt provides all DataStore instances through proper @Provides methods
- Verified build succeeds with no import errors

---

## 4. Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests
- **Total tests**: 100 (all passing)
- **Test coverage**:
  - `MatchMapperTest.kt`: 10 tests verifying bidirectional mapping with **zero data loss**
  - `MatchUseCasesTest.kt`: 7 tests for SaveMatchUseCase and GetMatchesUseCase
  - `MatchHistoryViewModelTest.kt`: 5 tests for match display logic
  - `ScoreViewModelTest.kt`: 9 tests including auto-save functionality

### Build Validation
```bash
./gradlew clean build
# Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 58s
# 131 actionable tasks: 128 executed, 3 up-to-date
```

### Key Test Cases
1. **Bidirectional mapping preserves all data**:
   ```kotlin
   // Entity → Domain → Entity (round trip)
   val originalEntity = MatchEntity(id = 123L, playerOneName = "Kate", ...)
   val domain = mapper.mapFromEntity(originalEntity)
   val resultEntity = mapper.mapToEntity(domain)
   assertEquals(originalEntity, resultEntity)  // ✅ All fields preserved
   ```

2. **Domain → Entity → Domain (round trip)**:
   ```kotlin
   val originalMatch = Match(id = "456", playerOneName = "Mia", ...)
   val entity = mapper.mapToEntity(originalMatch)
   val resultMatch = mapper.mapFromEntity(entity)
   assertEquals(originalMatch, resultMatch)  // ✅ All fields preserved
   ```

3. **Auto-save functionality**:
   - Verified matches are auto-saved when game finishes
   - Confirmed saved matches have correct player names and scores

### Files Modified
- `domain/model/Match.kt` (simplified model)
- `data/mapper/MatchMapper.kt` (clean mapping)
- `ui/scorescreen/ScoreViewModel.kt` (creates simplified Match)
- `ui/matchhistory/MatchHistoryScreen.kt` (displays new structure)
- `data/datasource/SettingsDataStore.kt` (removed global extension)
- `di/DataModule.kt` (private DataStore extensions)
- 4 test files updated with new Match structure

### Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ The `Match` domain model accurately represents database data without data loss
✅ The DataStore dependency is provided exclusively by Hilt
✅ Tests for `MatchMapper` are written and pass (10 comprehensive tests)
✅ All 100 unit tests pass
✅ Clean build successful
