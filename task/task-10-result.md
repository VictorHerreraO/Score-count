# Development Task Completion Report

**Task Title:**
Refactor UI Layer Architecture

**Date Completed:**
2025-10-11

---

## 1. What Was Done

Refactored the UI layer to eliminate architectural violations and ensure proper Clean Architecture principles throughout the codebase. The main changes included:

- Created `MainViewModel` to remove direct repository dependency from `MainActivity`
- Moved winner detection business logic from `ScoreViewModel` to the domain layer (`ScoreCalculator`)
- Enhanced `ResetGameUseCase` to orchestrate winner determination automatically
- Simplified `ScoreViewModel` to pure delegation with no business logic
- Note: Nullable StateFlows were already addressed in previous work, so this aspect was verified and confirmed complete

**Pull Request:** [#2](https://github.com/VictorHerreraO/Score-count/pull/2)

## 2. How It Was Done

### Architecture Analysis

First reviewed `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand Clean Architecture principles:
- UI layer should only depend on domain (ViewModels, UseCases)
- Domain layer contains pure business logic (ScoreCalculator) and orchestration (UseCases)
- Dependencies flow: UI → Domain → Data

### Implementation Steps

**1. Added `ScoreCalculator.determineWinner()` (domain/calculator/ScoreCalculator.kt:201)**
```kotlin
fun determineWinner(gameState: GameState): Int? {
    return when {
        gameState.player1SetsWon > gameState.player2SetsWon -> gameState.player1.id
        gameState.player2SetsWon > gameState.player1SetsWon -> gameState.player2.id
        else -> null
    }
}
```
Pure function with zero dependencies, easily testable.

**2. Updated `ResetGameUseCase` (domain/usecase/ResetGameUseCase.kt:23)**
```kotlin
// Auto-determine winner if not provided
val winnerId = lastGameWinnerId ?: ScoreCalculator.determineWinner(currentState)
```
UseCase now orchestrates: fetch state → calculate winner → reset → save.

**3. Created `MainViewModel` (ui/main/MainViewModel.kt)**
```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModel @Inject constructor(
    settingsRepository: SettingsRepository
) : ViewModel() {
    val settings: StateFlow<GameSettings> = settingsRepository.getSettings()
}
```
Follows existing ViewModel pattern, exposes settings StateFlow.

**4. Updated `MainActivity` (MainActivity.kt:30-31)**
```kotlin
val mainViewModel: MainViewModel = hiltViewModel()
val settings by mainViewModel.settings.collectAsState()
```
Removed direct `SettingsRepository` injection, now uses ViewModel.

**5. Simplified `ScoreViewModel.resetGame()` (ui/scorescreen/ScoreViewModel.kt:63-67)**
```kotlin
fun resetGame() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        resetGameUseCase()
    }
}
```
Removed winner detection logic, pure delegation to UseCase.

**6. Added comprehensive tests**
- 4 tests for `ScoreCalculator.determineWinner()` (all scenarios covered)
- 3 tests for `MainViewModel` (settings exposure, updates, defaults)
- Updated `ScoreViewModelTest` to reflect simplified behavior

### Tools & Technologies
- Kotlin coroutines (StateFlow, viewModelScope)
- Hilt for dependency injection
- JUnit 5 (Jupiter) for testing
- Fake repositories for test isolation
- GitHub CLI for PR and issue management

## 3. Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Choosing the Right Approach for MainActivity

**Problem:** Multiple ways to resolve MainActivity's repository dependency:
- Option A: Create new `MainViewModel`
- Option B: Reuse existing `SettingsViewModel`
- Option C: Create a helper/manager class
- Option D: Keep current implementation

**Resolution:** After detailed comparison of all options considering lines of code, architectural consistency, semantic clarity, and future-proofing, chose Option A (MainViewModel) because:
- Maintains consistency with existing ViewModel pattern
- Proper separation of concerns
- Future-proof for MainActivity-specific logic
- Follows established project patterns

**User feedback was crucial here** - initially jumped to MainViewModel without thorough evaluation, user pushed back requesting comparison of alternatives, leading to better decision-making.

### Challenge 2: StateFlows Already Non-Nullable

**Problem:** Task specification mentioned making StateFlows non-nullable, but they were already non-nullable in current codebase.

**Resolution:** Verified current implementation, confirmed this aspect was already complete from previous work, adjusted scope accordingly.

### Challenge 3: PR Feedback Process

**Problem:** After PR creation, received feedback about:
- Using `.value` instead of `.first()` for StateFlow access
- Consolidating duplicate test fake repositories

**Resolution:**
- Updated tests to use synchronous `.value` access (simpler, more appropriate)
- Created issue #3 for test fakes consolidation (valid but out-of-scope)
- Replied to each comment with brief description and signature
- This workflow led to creating `/addressPrFeedback` slash command

## 4. Testing & Validation

### Test Results
- **All 104 tests passing** (added 7 new tests)
- Build successful with no errors or warnings
- No test coverage regressions

### New Tests Added
1. `ScoreCalculatorTest.determineWinner returns player 1 id when player 1 has more sets`
2. `ScoreCalculatorTest.determineWinner returns player 2 id when player 2 has more sets`
3. `ScoreCalculatorTest.determineWinner returns null when sets are tied`
4. `ScoreCalculatorTest.determineWinner returns null when both players have zero sets`
5. `MainViewModelTest.viewModel exposes settings from repository`
6. `MainViewModelTest.viewModel settings updates when repository updates`
7. `MainViewModelTest.viewModel exposes default settings on initialization`

### Test Patterns
- Used fake repository implementations for isolation
- Followed Given-When-Then structure
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Maintained consistency with existing test styles

### Acceptance Criteria Status
- ✅ `MainActivity` no longer has any dependency on a repository
- ✅ `ScoreViewModel` is cleaner and delegates all business logic
- ⚠️ Loading spinner removal: Not applicable - StateFlows were already non-nullable, no spinner existed

## Additional Work

### Documentation
- Created `/addressPrFeedback` slash command documenting PR feedback workflow
- Comprehensive PR description with before/after comparisons
- Detailed commit messages with proper attribution

### Task Management Migration
- Transitioned to GitHub issues for task management
- Created issue #3 for future test fakes consolidation
- Established pattern for deferring out-of-scope work
