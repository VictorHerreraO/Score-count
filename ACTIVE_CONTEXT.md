# Active Context: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks the development progress of the Score-Count application.

## Accomplished So Far:

*   **Project Initialization & Understanding**:
    *   Understood the request to build a Compose UI similar to an HTML example.
    *   Clarified the package name to `com.soyvictorherrera.scorecount`.
*   **Architecture Planning**:
    *   Defined a layered architecture: UI, Domain, and Data layers.
    *   Planned for ViewModels, Use Cases, Repositories, and Data Sources.
*   **Core Directory Structure**:
    *   Established the main package structure for `ui`, `domain`, and `data` layers.
*   **Domain Layer Implementation**:
    *   Models: `Player.kt` (with `id`, `name`, `score`), `GameState.kt` (with `player1`, `player2`, `servingPlayerId`, `isFinished`).
    *   Repository Interface: `ScoreRepository.kt`.
    *   Use Cases: Implemented all core use cases (`GetGameStateUseCase`, `IncrementScoreUseCase`, `DecrementScoreUseCase`, `SwitchServeUseCase`, `ResetGameUseCase`, `UndoLastActionUseCase`), injecting `ScoreRepository`.
*   **Data Layer Implementation**:
    *   DataSource: `LocalScoreDataSource.kt` (in-memory, aligned with refined `Player` and `GameState` models).
    *   Repository Implementation: `ScoreRepositoryImpl.kt`.
*   **UI Theming (`ui/theme/`)**:
    *   Created `Color.kt` with a basic color palette.
    *   Created `Type.kt` with basic typography definitions.
    *   Created `Theme.kt` with the main `ScoreCountTheme` Composable, including light/dark theme handling.
*   **Dependency Injection with Hilt**:
    *   Added Hilt and KSP dependencies and plugins to `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle.kts`.
    *   Created `ScoreCountApplication.kt` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp` and updated `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    *   Annotated `ScoreViewModel.kt` with `@HiltViewModel` and used `@Inject constructor(...)` for its Use Case dependencies.
    *   Created Hilt modules (`DataModule.kt`, `RepositoryModule.kt`) to provide `LocalScoreDataSource` and bind `ScoreRepository`.
*   **UI Layer Integration**:
    *   Created `MainActivity.kt` annotated with `@AndroidEntryPoint`, responsible for setting up `ScoreScreen` with a Hilt-injected `ScoreViewModel`.
    *   Updated `ScoreScreen.kt` and `ScoreViewModel.kt` to align with refined domain models and Hilt integration.
*   **Gradle & Build Configuration**:
    *   Updated `gradle/libs.versions.toml` with versions and aliases for Jetpack Compose, ViewModel, Lifecycle, Coroutines, Activity Compose, Hilt, and KSP.
    *   Configured Kotlin Compose Compiler, Hilt, and KSP plugins in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
*   **Build & Error Resolution**:
    *   Resolved Kotlin Kapt plugin alias issue by applying `id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt")` directly.
    *   Fixed experimental API opt-in issues for Material 3 components (e.g., `TopAppBar`, `Button`).
    *   Addressed deprecated API usage (e.g., `Icons.Filled.Undo` changed to `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.Undo`).
    *   Corrected `GameState.kt` content to align with the intended architecture (including `isFinished` and ensuring players hold scores).
    *   Fixed Hilt/Dagger `MissingBinding` error for `ScoreRepositoryImpl` by adding `@Inject` to its constructor, allowing the app to compile.

## Currently Working On:

*   The application now compiles successfully after resolving the Hilt DI issues.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Thorough Testing**: Test the application on an emulator/device to ensure all functionalities work as expected with injected dependencies and recent fixes.
2.  **Refine UI and UX**: Polish the UI, add animations if desired, and improve the overall user experience based on testing.
3.  **Implement `UndoLastActionUseCase` Logic**: Fully implement the undo logic within `UndoLastActionUseCase` and `LocalScoreDataSource` if the current implementation is a placeholder.
4.  **Persistence Strategy**: Evaluate and potentially implement a persistence solution (e.g., SharedPreferences for simple state or Room for more complex data) to replace the in-memory `LocalScoreDataSource`.
5.  **Address `TODO`s**: Review the codebase for any pending `TODO` items and implement them.
6.  **Refine Composable Previews**: Enhance `@Preview` setups in `ScoreScreen.kt` for better UI iteration, ensuring they work correctly with the latest model and state structures.
7.  **Update Documentation**: Continuously update `ARCHITECTURE.md` and other relevant documentation as the project evolves.
