## Current Work: Fixed serve rotation bug with non-standard game settings (Task #42 - Done)

### Summary
Fixed a critical bug in the serve rotation logic where the serve indicator switched at incorrect point counts when non-standard "Set to" values were configured. The original formula was mathematically flawed and worked accidentally for standard cases but failed with edge cases.

### Root Cause
The serve rotation formula in `ScoreCalculator.kt:294-295` was:
```kotlin
(totalPointsInCurrentSet - serveInterval - 1) % serveInterval == 0
```

This formula was:
- Overly complex and mathematically incorrect
- Worked accidentally for standard interval=2 cases
- Failed for non-standard "Set to" values and serve intervals
- Lacked comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

### Solution
Replaced the complex formula with a simple, correct interval-based rotation check:
```kotlin
val intervalNumber = (totalPointsInCurrentSet - 1) / serveInterval
val previousIntervalNumber = if (previousTotal > 0) (previousTotal - 1) / serveInterval else 0
val switchedInterval = intervalNumber != previousIntervalNumber
```

This approach:
- Determines which serve interval we're in (0-indexed)
- Detects transitions between intervals
- Rotates serve when intervals change
- Works correctly regardless of "Set to" or serve interval values

### Files Changed
- `app/src/main/java/com/soyvictorherrera/scorecount/domain/calculator/ScoreCalculator.kt`
  - Fixed `determineNextServer()` method (lines 283-314)
  - Simplified serve rotation logic with interval-based approach

- `app/src/test/java/com/soyvictorherrera/scorecount/domain/calculator/ScoreCalculatorTest.kt`
  - Added comprehensive test: `serve rotation works correctly with Set to 7 and rotation after 2`
  - Added test: `serve rotation works correctly with Set to 21 and rotation after 5`
  - Added test: `serve rotation works with Set to 7 alternating scores`
  - Added test: `deuce transition maintains correct server with Set to 7`
  - Added test: `deuce transition at 10-10 with standard settings`
  - Added test: `serve rotation with interval of 3`
  - Total: 113 tests, all passing

### Testing
All acceptance criteria from issue #42 verified:
- ✅ Serve indicator switches at correct intervals according to "Serve rotation after" setting
- ✅ Behavior is consistent regardless of "Set to" value (tested with 7, 11, 21)
- ✅ Serve rotation correctly handles deuce transitions
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests added for various configurations

Build status:
- ✅ All 113 unit tests pass
- ✅ Lint checks pass (detekt, ktlint)
- ✅ Code compiles successfully

### Status
✅ Complete - Bug fixed, thoroughly tested, ready for review

### Next Steps
- Create feature branch for task #42
- Commit changes with detailed commit message
- No merge - allow manual review before merging
