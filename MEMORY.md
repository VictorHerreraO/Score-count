# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks development work that is currently in progress and has not yet been completed for the Score-Count application.

## In Progress:

*Waiting for the next development task.*

## Next Steps:

1.  **Test the Updated Settings Screen**: Thoroughly test all UI components and verify that settings are saved and correctly applied to the game logic.
2.  **Implement Pending Actions**: The "Show previous sets" action is not yet implemented. This should be addressed.
3.  **Code Cleanup**: Review the codebase for any obsolete code or `TODO` comments that can be addressed.
4.  **Documentation**: Keep project documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.MD`, etc.) up-to-date with any changes.
