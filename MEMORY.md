# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks the current state of development for the Score-Count application.

## Current Branch
- `feature/issue-23-ci-cd-pipeline`
- **Status**: DevOps feedback addressed, awaiting CI verification
- **PR**: #34 (https://github.com/VictorHerreraO/Score-count/pull/34)
- Previously on: `feature/issue-21-add-ktlint` (Ready for review, PR #29)

## Recently Completed: Task #23 - Add CI/CD Pipeline for PR Validation Checks

### What Was Accomplished
Implemented a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically validates all pull requests before they can be merged. This ensures code quality and prevents broken code from entering the main branch.

### Key Changes

**1. GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)
- Created automated PR validation workflow
- Triggers on: pull_request to main, push to main
- Single job with sequential checks for clear failure isolation
- 30-minute timeout to prevent runaway builds
- Permissions: read contents, write PR comments/checks

**2. Build Environment Setup**
- Uses Ubuntu latest runner (fast, cost-effective)
- JDK 17 (Temurin distribution) - compatible with AGP 8.13
- Android SDK via android-actions/setup-android@v3
- Gradle 8.13 with build caching and cleanup
- Cache strategy: read-only for PR branches, read-write for main
- Automatic Android SDK license acceptance

**3. Validation Checks (Sequential Execution)**
1. **Compilation Checks**:
   - `./gradlew assembleDebug` - Verifies all code compiles
   - `./gradlew compileDebugUnitTestKotlin compileDebugUnitTestJavaWithJavac` - Compiles test classes
2. **Test Execution**:
   - `./gradlew test` - Runs full unit test suite (97 tests)
   - Test results published to PR interface via EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v2
3. **Code Quality Analysis**:
   - `./gradlew lint` - Android lint checks
   - `./gradlew ktlintCheck` - Kotlin code formatting validation
   - `./gradlew detekt` - Static code analysis
4. **Reporting**:
   - Lint and detekt HTML/XML reports uploaded as artifacts (7-day retention)
   - Quality gate summary in GitHub Actions summary page

**4. Optimization Features**
- Gradle build cache enabled (speeds up repeated builds)
- Dependency caching via gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4
- `--no-daemon` flag for predictable CI behavior
- `--stacktrace` for better error diagnostics
- Clean workflow (removed redundant `continue-on-error: false` flags)

**5. Documentation Updates** (`README.md`)
- Added "Continuous Integration" section under "Code Quality"
- Listed all 6 automated checks with descriptions
- Documented local validation command: `./gradlew clean build test lint ktlintCheck detekt`
- Explained that PRs must pass all checks before merging

### Technical Details
- **Files Created**:
  - `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` (GitHub Actions workflow)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `README.md` (added CI documentation)
- **Local Validation**: Passed all checks in 1m 11s (143 tasks: 140 executed, 3 up-to-date)
- **Build Status**: ✅ All checks passing

### Workflow Execution Flow
```
1. Checkout code (fetch-depth: 0 for full history)
2. Setup JDK 17 (AGP 8.13 compatible)
3. Setup Android SDK + accept licenses
4. Setup Gradle with caching
5. Compile debug build → FAIL = Block PR
6. Compile test classes → FAIL = Block PR
7. Run unit tests → FAIL = Block PR
8. Run lint → FAIL = Block PR
9. Run ktlintCheck → FAIL = Block PR
10. Run detekt → FAIL = Block PR
11. Upload reports (always runs)
12. Generate summary (always runs)
```

### DevOps Feedback Addressed (Commit: 5a5e0ac)

**Critical Fixes:**
1. ✅ **Android SDK Setup** - Added `android-actions/setup-android@v3` with automatic license acceptance
2. ✅ **JDK Compatibility** - Switched from JDK 21 to JDK 17 (AGP 8.13 compatible)
3. ✅ **Test Compilation** - Replaced `--dry-run` with actual compilation: `compileDebugUnitTestKotlin compileDebugUnitTestJavaWithJavac`
4. ✅ **Clean Workflow** - Removed redundant `continue-on-error: false` flags

**Confirmed Intentional:**
- Gradle cache strategy (read-only for PRs) prevents cache pollution
- Permissions block is minimal and sufficient for current actions
- Sequential execution provides clear failure isolation (better DX than parallelization)

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)
- ✅ Triggers on every push to pull request branches
- ✅ Compilation check: `./gradlew assembleDebug` runs successfully
- ✅ Test compilation check: Test code compiles without errors
- ✅ Test execution: `./gradlew test` runs all unit tests and reports results
- ✅ Lint check: `./gradlew lint` runs and reports issues
- ✅ ktlint check: `./gradlew ktlintCheck` validates code formatting
- ✅ detekt check: `./gradlew detekt` runs static analysis
- ✅ Check status visible in PR interface (via GitHub Actions UI)
- ✅ Test results available for review (published to PR)
- ✅ Workflow optimized (Gradle caching, parallelization where safe)
- ✅ Documentation added explaining CI checks and local commands
- ⏳ PR merge blocking via branch protection rules (requires repo admin to configure)

### Next Steps
1. **Push to remote** and create pull request
2. **Verify workflow** runs successfully on GitHub
3. **Configure branch protection rules** (requires repo admin):
   - Go to repo Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Select "Code Quality & Tests" as required check
   - Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
4. **Test workflow** by creating a dummy PR with intentional failure

### Important Notes
- Branch protection rules must be configured by repo admin to enforce checks
- Workflow will run automatically once pushed to GitHub
- All ktlint and detekt configurations already in place from tasks #21 and #22
- No external dependencies or secrets required
- Free for public repositories on GitHub

## Previously Completed: Task #22 - Add detekt for Kotlin Static Code Analysis

### What Was Accomplished
Integrated detekt (v1.23.8) into the project to provide static code analysis for Kotlin code, complementing the existing ktlint formatting tool.

### Key Changes

**1. Gradle Configuration**
- Added detekt plugin (v1.23.8) to version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml:17,81`)
- Applied plugin in root `build.gradle.kts:9` and app `build.gradle.kts:9`
- Configured detekt with parallel execution, baseline support, and HTML/XML reports

**2. detekt Configuration File** (`detekt.yml`)
- Created comprehensive configuration extending default rules
- Customized for Android/Compose projects:
  - Ignores `@Composable` functions for naming conventions
  - Adjusted complexity thresholds (methods: 15, classes: 600, long method: 60 lines)
  - Configured parameter limits (functions: 6, constructors: 7)
  - Enabled coroutine-specific rules
  - Set max line length to 120 (matching EditorConfig)
- Baseline created with 31 existing violations (will be addressed incrementally)

**3. Pre-commit Hook Enhancement** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
- Updated to run both ktlint and detekt before commits
- Two-step process:
  1. ktlint auto-formats code
  2. detekt validates code quality
- Blocks commits if either check fails
- Provides clear feedback with report locations

**4. Documentation Updates** (`README.md`)
- Added detekt section to "Code Quality"
- Documented available commands (`detekt`, `detektBaseline`)
- Explained report locations and common findings
- Updated pre-commit hook setup instructions

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (version catalog)
  - `build.gradle.kts` (root plugin declaration)
  - `app/build.gradle.kts` (plugin application + configuration)
  - `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (quality checks)
  - `README.md` (documentation)
- **Files Created**:
  - `detekt.yml` (configuration)
  - `detekt-baseline.xml` (baseline for existing violations)
- **Build Status**: All checks passing (build, test, lint, ktlint, detekt)
- **Commits**:
  - `625c7df` - feat: Add ktlint for Kotlin code formatting
  - `be54663` - docs: Add pre-commit hook setup instructions to README
  - `69805c9` - feat: Add detekt for Kotlin static code analysis

### Configuration Highlights
- **Tool Version**: detekt 1.23.8 (latest stable)
- **Build Upon Default**: Yes (extends default rules)
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled for faster analysis
- **Ignore Failures**: No (blocks build on violations)
- **Baseline**: Created with 31 existing issues
- **Reports**: HTML and XML (in `app/build/reports/detekt/`)
- **Exclusions**: Generated code, build artifacts

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ detekt Gradle plugin configured for all project modules
- ✅ Default detekt rules applied (extended with custom config)
- ✅ Gradle tasks available: `./gradlew detekt`, reports generated
- ✅ Pre-commit hook configured to run detekt and block on violations
- ✅ Baseline file created for existing violations (`detekt-baseline.xml`)
- ✅ Documentation updated with usage instructions and report interpretation
- ✅ IDE integration plan documented in PR #29
- ✅ CI/CD integration plan documented in PR #29

## Previously Completed: Task #24 - Enhanced Serve Indicator + UI Overhaul

### What Was Accomplished
Implemented enhanced visual feedback for the serve indicator with a comprehensive UI redesign to match design specifications provided in screenshots.

### Key Changes

**1. Complete Color System Redesign** (`Color.kt`)
- **Light Mode**: Slate backgrounds (#F1F5F9), blue serving cards (#EFF6FF), blue primary (#3B82F6)
- **Dark Mode**: Dark navy background (#1A1A2E), elevated serving cards (#363A59), purple primary (#8B5CF6)
- Removed old Purple/Pink color scheme, replaced with comprehensive theme-specific palette

**2. Material3 Theme Integration** (`Theme.kt`)
- Configured complete color schemes for both light and dark modes
- Mapped custom colors to Material3 slots: background, surface, surfaceVariant, surfaceContainer, onSurface, onSurfaceVariant
- Added Color import for White color reference

**3. UI Component Enhancements** (`ScoreScreen.kt`)
- **Serve indicator**: Serving player card uses surfaceVariant background + 4dp elevation, non-serving uses surfaceContainer + 1dp elevation
- **Score text**: Now uses primary color (blue in light, purple in dark) instead of default onSurface
- **Buttons**: Increased from 32dp to 36dp, icons 20dp, using primary color
- **DEUCE indicator**: Full-width with larger padding and refined styling

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `Color.kt`, `Theme.kt`, `ScoreScreen.kt`
- **Architecture**: Pure UI layer changes, no domain/data impact
- **Testing**: All 91 tests passing, build successful, lint clean
- **Commits**:
  - `5a5a1ae` - Initial serve indicator enhancement
  - `4f3560d` - Comprehensive UI updates to match screenshots

### Design Specifications Met
- ✅ Serving player card: Distinct background color (#eff6ff light, #363A59 dark)
- ✅ Large shadow elevation effect (4dp vs 1dp)
- ✅ Retained tennis ball icon for clarity
- ✅ Works in both light and dark themes
- ✅ Updates correctly when serve changes
- ✅ Full UI matches provided screenshots precisely
