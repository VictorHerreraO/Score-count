# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks the current state of development for the Score-Count application.

## Current Branch
- `feature/issue-24-enhanced-serve-indicator`
- **Status**: Ready for review
- **PR**: #25

## Recently Completed: Task #24 - Enhanced Serve Indicator + UI Overhaul

### What Was Accomplished
Implemented enhanced visual feedback for the serve indicator with a comprehensive UI redesign to match design specifications provided in screenshots.

### Key Changes

**1. Complete Color System Redesign** (`Color.kt`)
- **Light Mode**: Slate backgrounds (#F1F5F9), blue serving cards (#EFF6FF), blue primary (#3B82F6)
- **Dark Mode**: Dark navy background (#1A1A2E), elevated serving cards (#363A59), purple primary (#8B5CF6)
- Removed old Purple/Pink color scheme, replaced with comprehensive theme-specific palette

**2. Material3 Theme Integration** (`Theme.kt`)
- Configured complete color schemes for both light and dark modes
- Mapped custom colors to Material3 slots: background, surface, surfaceVariant, surfaceContainer, onSurface, onSurfaceVariant
- Added Color import for White color reference

**3. UI Component Enhancements** (`ScoreScreen.kt`)
- **Serve indicator**: Serving player card uses surfaceVariant background + 4dp elevation, non-serving uses surfaceContainer + 1dp elevation
- **Score text**: Now uses primary color (blue in light, purple in dark) instead of default onSurface
- **Buttons**: Increased from 32dp to 36dp, icons 20dp, using primary color
- **DEUCE indicator**: Full-width with larger padding and refined styling

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `Color.kt`, `Theme.kt`, `ScoreScreen.kt`
- **Architecture**: Pure UI layer changes, no domain/data impact
- **Testing**: All 91 tests passing, build successful, lint clean
- **Commits**:
  - `5a5a1ae` - Initial serve indicator enhancement
  - `4f3560d` - Comprehensive UI updates to match screenshots

### Design Specifications Met
- ✅ Serving player card: Distinct background color (#eff6ff light, #363A59 dark)
- ✅ Large shadow elevation effect (4dp vs 1dp)
- ✅ Retained tennis ball icon for clarity
- ✅ Works in both light and dark themes
- ✅ Updates correctly when serve changes
- ✅ Full UI matches provided screenshots precisely

## Project Status

### Completed Features
1. **Score Screen UI**: Portrait and landscape layouts
2. **Match History Screen**: Domain, data, and UI layers with navigation
3. **GameState Persistence**: Proto DataStore implementation with automatic restoration
4. **Enhanced Serve Indicator**: Visual feedback with comprehensive UI redesign (Task #24)

### Important Notes
- **Undo Feature**: Never implemented in codebase, no undo-related code exists
- **Dynamic Colors**: App supports Android S+ dynamic colors with fallback to static schemes
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches follow `feature/issue-XX-description` pattern
- **Commits**: Small, focused commits with descriptive messages

## Pending Work

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Testing**: Test enhanced serve indicator and UI changes on device/emulator
   - Verify light mode colors and serving card elevation
   - Verify dark mode colors and serving card elevation
   - Test serve switching behavior
   - Check both portrait and landscape orientations

2. **Match History Feature**:
   - Match detail screen navigation
   - New match creation flow
   - Filtering functionality

3. **UI Features**:
   - "Show previous sets" feature implementation
