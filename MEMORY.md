# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks the current state of development for the Score-Count application.

## Current Branch
- `feature/issue-21-add-ktlint`
- **Status**: Implementation in progress (detekt integration completed)
- Previously on: `feature/issue-24-enhanced-serve-indicator` (Ready for review, PR #25)

## Recently Completed: Task #22 - Add detekt for Kotlin Static Code Analysis

### What Was Accomplished
Integrated detekt (v1.23.8) into the project to provide static code analysis for Kotlin code, complementing the existing ktlint formatting tool.

### Key Changes

**1. Gradle Configuration**
- Added detekt plugin (v1.23.8) to version catalog (`gradle/libs.versions.toml:17,81`)
- Applied plugin in root `build.gradle.kts:9` and app `build.gradle.kts:9`
- Configured detekt with parallel execution, baseline support, and HTML/XML reports

**2. detekt Configuration File** (`detekt.yml`)
- Created comprehensive configuration extending default rules
- Customized for Android/Compose projects:
  - Ignores `@Composable` functions for naming conventions
  - Adjusted complexity thresholds (methods: 15, classes: 600, long method: 60 lines)
  - Configured parameter limits (functions: 6, constructors: 7)
  - Enabled coroutine-specific rules
  - Set max line length to 120 (matching EditorConfig)
- Baseline created with 31 existing violations (will be addressed incrementally)

**3. Pre-commit Hook Enhancement** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
- Updated to run both ktlint and detekt before commits
- Two-step process:
  1. ktlint auto-formats code
  2. detekt validates code quality
- Blocks commits if either check fails
- Provides clear feedback with report locations

**4. Documentation Updates** (`README.md`)
- Added detekt section to "Code Quality"
- Documented available commands (`detekt`, `detektBaseline`)
- Explained report locations and common findings
- Updated pre-commit hook setup instructions

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (version catalog)
  - `build.gradle.kts` (root plugin declaration)
  - `app/build.gradle.kts` (plugin application + configuration)
  - `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (quality checks)
  - `README.md` (documentation)
- **Files Created**:
  - `detekt.yml` (configuration)
  - `detekt-baseline.xml` (baseline for existing violations)
- **Build Status**: All checks passing (build, test, lint, ktlint, detekt)
- **Commits**: To be created after implementation complete

### Configuration Highlights
- **Tool Version**: detekt 1.23.8 (latest stable)
- **Build Upon Default**: Yes (extends default rules)
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled for faster analysis
- **Ignore Failures**: No (blocks build on violations)
- **Baseline**: Created with 31 existing issues
- **Reports**: HTML and XML (in `app/build/reports/detekt/`)
- **Exclusions**: Generated code, build artifacts

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ detekt Gradle plugin configured for all project modules
- ✅ Default detekt rules applied (extended with custom config)
- ✅ Gradle tasks available: `./gradlew detekt`, reports generated
- ✅ Pre-commit hook configured to run detekt and block on violations
- ✅ Baseline file created for existing violations (`detekt-baseline.xml`)
- ✅ Documentation updated with usage instructions and report interpretation
- ⏳ IDE integration plan (recommend detekt IntelliJ plugin in PR comments)
- ⏳ CI/CD integration plan (document in PR)

## Previously Completed: Task #24 - Enhanced Serve Indicator + UI Overhaul

### What Was Accomplished
Implemented enhanced visual feedback for the serve indicator with a comprehensive UI redesign to match design specifications provided in screenshots.

### Key Changes

**1. Complete Color System Redesign** (`Color.kt`)
- **Light Mode**: Slate backgrounds (#F1F5F9), blue serving cards (#EFF6FF), blue primary (#3B82F6)
- **Dark Mode**: Dark navy background (#1A1A2E), elevated serving cards (#363A59), purple primary (#8B5CF6)
- Removed old Purple/Pink color scheme, replaced with comprehensive theme-specific palette

**2. Material3 Theme Integration** (`Theme.kt`)
- Configured complete color schemes for both light and dark modes
- Mapped custom colors to Material3 slots: background, surface, surfaceVariant, surfaceContainer, onSurface, onSurfaceVariant
- Added Color import for White color reference

**3. UI Component Enhancements** (`ScoreScreen.kt`)
- **Serve indicator**: Serving player card uses surfaceVariant background + 4dp elevation, non-serving uses surfaceContainer + 1dp elevation
- **Score text**: Now uses primary color (blue in light, purple in dark) instead of default onSurface
- **Buttons**: Increased from 32dp to 36dp, icons 20dp, using primary color
- **DEUCE indicator**: Full-width with larger padding and refined styling

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `Color.kt`, `Theme.kt`, `ScoreScreen.kt`
- **Architecture**: Pure UI layer changes, no domain/data impact
- **Testing**: All 91 tests passing, build successful, lint clean
- **Commits**:
  - `5a5a1ae` - Initial serve indicator enhancement
  - `4f3560d` - Comprehensive UI updates to match screenshots

### Design Specifications Met
- ✅ Serving player card: Distinct background color (#eff6ff light, #363A59 dark)
- ✅ Large shadow elevation effect (4dp vs 1dp)
- ✅ Retained tennis ball icon for clarity
- ✅ Works in both light and dark themes
- ✅ Updates correctly when serve changes
- ✅ Full UI matches provided screenshots precisely

## Project Status

### Completed Features
1. **Score Screen UI**: Portrait and landscape layouts
2. **Match History Screen**: Domain, data, and UI layers with navigation
3. **GameState Persistence**: Proto DataStore implementation with automatic restoration
4. **Enhanced Serve Indicator**: Visual feedback with comprehensive UI redesign (Task #24)

### Important Notes
- **Undo Feature**: Never implemented in codebase, no undo-related code exists
- **Dynamic Colors**: App supports Android S+ dynamic colors with fallback to static schemes
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches follow `feature/issue-XX-description` pattern
- **Commits**: Small, focused commits with descriptive messages

## Pending Work

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Testing**: Test enhanced serve indicator and UI changes on device/emulator
   - Verify light mode colors and serving card elevation
   - Verify dark mode colors and serving card elevation
   - Test serve switching behavior
   - Check both portrait and landscape orientations

2. **Match History Feature**:
   - Match detail screen navigation
   - New match creation flow
   - Filtering functionality

3. **UI Features**:
   - "Show previous sets" feature implementation
