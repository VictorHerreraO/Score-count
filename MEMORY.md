# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks development work that is currently in progress and has not yet been completed for the Score-Count application.

## Completed:

*   **Feature: Score Screen UI Update**: The UI for the Score Screen has been updated to support both portrait and landscape layouts, providing an improved user experience on different device orientations.
*   **Feature: Match History Screen**: The initial implementation of the Match History screen is complete. This includes the domain, data, and UI layers, as well as navigation from the main score screen.
*   **Feature: GameState Persistence (Task 07)**: GameState now persists to disk using Proto DataStore, surviving app process death and device restarts. The implementation includes:
    *   Proto DataStore setup with GameStateProto schema
    *   Automatic state restoration on app launch
    *   LocalScoreDataSource refactored to use persistent storage
    *   All tests passing (91 tests)

## Important Notes:

*   **Undo Feature**: The task documentation mentioned an "undo" feature, but this was never implemented in the codebase. No undo-related code exists. This has been documented and clarified.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Manual Testing (Task 07)**: Test GameState persistence by:
    *   Starting a game and changing scores
    *   Force-stopping the app from system settings
    *   Relaunching to verify state is restored
2.  **Complete Match History Feature**:
    *   Implement navigation to a "Match Detail" screen when a match is tapped.
    *   Implement the "New Match" floating action button to navigate to a screen for creating a new match.
    *   Implement filtering functionality for the match history list.
3.  **Implement Pending UI Actions**: The "Show previous sets" feature is still pending implementation.
