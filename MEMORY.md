# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks development work that is currently in progress and has not yet been completed for the Score-Count application.

## Completed:

*   **Feature: Score Screen UI Update**: The UI for the Score Screen has been updated to support both portrait and landscape layouts, providing an improved user experience on different device orientations.
*   **Feature: Match History Screen**: The initial implementation of the Match History screen is complete. This includes the domain, data, and UI layers, as well as navigation from the main score screen.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Complete Match History Feature**:
    *   Implement navigation to a "Match Detail" screen when a match is tapped.
    *   Implement the "New Match" floating action button to navigate to a screen for creating a new match.
    *   Implement filtering functionality for the match history list.
2.  **Test DataStore Migration**: Thoroughly test the recent migration from `SharedPreferences` to `Preferences DataStore`. This includes:
    *   Verifying that settings are correctly saved and loaded across app restarts.
    *   Ensuring the reactive `getSettings` stream updates the UI and game logic correctly when settings change.
3.  **Implement Pending UI Actions**: The "Show previous sets" feature is still pending implementation.
4.  **Code Cleanup**: Review the codebase for any remaining artifacts from the `SharedPreferences` implementation or other obsolete code.
5.  **Review and Refine Game Logic**: Assess the core game logic in `LocalScoreDataSource` to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases related to the configurable settings.
