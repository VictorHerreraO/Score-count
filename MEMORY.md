# Memory: Score-Count App Development

This file tracks development work that is currently in progress and has not yet been completed for the Score-Count application.

## In Progress:

*Waiting for the next development task.*

## Next Steps:

1.  **Test DataStore Migration**: Thoroughly test the recent migration from `SharedPreferences` to `Preferences DataStore`. This includes:
    *   Verifying that settings are correctly saved and loaded across app restarts.
    *   Ensuring the reactive `getSettings` stream updates the UI and game logic correctly when settings change.
2.  **Implement Pending UI Actions**: The "Show previous sets" feature is still pending implementation.
3.  **Code Cleanup**: Review the codebase for any remaining artifacts from the `SharedPreferences` implementation or other obsolete code.
4.  **Review and Refine Game Logic**: Assess the core game logic in `LocalScoreDataSource` to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases related to the configurable settings.
